# Bonesoul
*A soul trapped in a cage of bones. Hails from the Nether.*

## Powers

### Pile o' Bones
You are comprised of a bunch of bones. Add bones to your pile to increase health, but decrease speed. Armor decreases speed as well. When below ten bones and with no armor, be able to fly.

### Incorporeal
You can't eat, but you also don't need to eat.

### Immortal
You can't die. Instead, when reaching 0 health, lose all bones and drop all items.

### Bone Knife
Your fist is a sharpened bone. It has the properties of a sword, with less damage but infinite durability.

### Spirit of the Undead
Smite is more effective on you. Healing potions damage you.

### Lose Control
Though it does not hurt you, liquids will disrupt your control of bones near you, causing your bones to be drained.
